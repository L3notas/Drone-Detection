The dataset includes 17081 images.
Quadcopter-fixedwing-laptop-pen are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -9 and +9 degrees
* Random shear of between -0째 to +0째 horizontally and -12째 to +12째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -14 and +14 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -11 and +11 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.49 percent of pixels
